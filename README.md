# Blog_Post_App
                   This is a Just Blog Post Application but Its follow the RESTful Principles
I used all the 7 RESTful principles to make this app & also used 'Semantic-ui' (this is a new css framework for styling)
In this app anyone can create a new blog, See all the previous blogs and also update/edit/delete any one of them 
Its just a practice application for RESTful Routes.

This App used :- 

1_html
| 2_css
| 3_Semantic-ui
| 4_Javacript ES6
| 5_node.js
| 6_Express.js
| 7_MongoDB
| 8_npm  diff packages like:  
                        | method-override
                        | body-parsar
                        | mongoose
    										| nodemon
												| ejs
                                                That's all for this App.
